                <h2>Workshop Description:</h2>
                <p>
                    As the demand for machine learning applications surges, it becomes evident that the available pool of knowledgeable data scientists cannot
                    scale proportionally with the increasing data volumes and diverse application requirements in our digital world. To address this challenge,
                    various automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks have emerged, aiming to bridge the gap in human expertise by automating the construction 
                    of machine learning pipelines. AutoML research aims to automate the machine learning process progressively, with the objective of making effective 
                    methods accessible to everyone. Therefore, the workshop is designed for a diverse audience, including core machine learning researchers involved
                    in various ML domains related to AutoML, such as neural architecture search, hyperparameter optimization, meta-learning, and explainability 
                    within the AutoML context. It also caters to domain experts seeking to apply machine learning to novel problem domains.

            <b>Submissions:</b> 
            
            <p>
            As workshop organizers, you will need to organize your own paper submission process, and ECAI cannot directly support you in that or cover any costs.
            However, there are a number of free tools available. Specifically, you are welcome to try a new tool (https://chairingtool.com) currently under development 
            for IJCAI, which as the organizer of an ECAI workshop you can use free of charge and with premium support.
            </p>

            <b>Format:</b>
            <p>
                The workshop will follow the classical format of presentations of peer-reviewed papers followed by
                discussion. The typical duration for the workshop is a full day. We will arrange invited talks
                from experts in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to enrich the workshop experience and provide
                valuable insights from leaders in the field.

            <p>
                The workshop is timely and relevant for the data management and machine learning research
                communities due to the rapid growth in machine learning applications in almost every application
                domain. The workshop is intended also to benefit designers and machine learning users in the broad
                area of machine learning. We anticipate receiving approximately 35 submissions.
